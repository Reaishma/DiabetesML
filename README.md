Diabetes Prediction Project 📊💻

Overview 🤔

This project aims to develop predictive models that can accurately classify individuals as diabetic or non-diabetic based on their health metrics.

Features 🎯

⭐️ *Machine Learning Model*: Logistic Regression model for diabetes prediction
⭐️ *Deep Learning Model*: Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) model for diabetes prediction

Technologies Used 💻

🔹 *Python*: The project is built using Python and utilizes popular libraries such as scikit-learn, pandas, and NumPy.

🔹 *Scikit-learn*: The project uses scikit-learn for machine learning tasks, including logistic regression and multilayer perceptron (MLP) models.

Installation 📦

To install the project, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository using `git clone
https://github.com/Reaishma/DiabetesML'
2. Install the required libraries using `pip install -r requirements.txt`
   - Required libraries:
     - pandas
     - scikit-learn
     - numpy

Usage 🤝

To use the models, simply run the corresponding Python files:
- For Logistic Regression 'model1.py
- For Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) Model: `model2.py`

Code Snippets 💡

- Logistic Regression Model: 
```python
model = LogisticRegression(max_iter=1000)
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

- Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) Model:
model = MLPClassifier(hidden_layer_sizes=(64, 32), max_iter=1000)
model.fit(X_train, y_train)
